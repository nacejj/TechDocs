Issue: 
Sometimes an organizer will get an error that their meeting cancellation failed to send but was removed from their own calendar. 

Solution:
Try and cancel all events in the series 
Manually notify all external participants 
IT to remove the calendar invite from the backend calendars for all internal participants. 

IT Process to remove calendar invites
Must go through change management since this can be destructive

Add Title, Type, and Sender to your search generally at a minimum. 
A detailed query search condition that could help you get started:
(c:c)(senderauthor=jlongfield@signaturedentalpartners.com)(subjecttitle="SDP State of the Union")(kind=meetings)(lastmodifiedtime=2024-01-01..2024-02-11)

Date does not work well for meetings because it's not the meeting's date but when the meeting was sent, which is generally unknown or far in the past for recurring meetings. 
Sometimes its best just deleting all meetings with that subject, then asking the organizers to re-create. 
Alternative solutions and good testing is needed to ensure the meeting title is unique. Try and use Sender/Author
Lastmodifiedtime is another good option for meetings

Searches take ~1-10 minutes by my experience.
